For CSSconf EU, Max will give a brand new talk in which he introduces
his latest project <a href="https://styled-components.com/" target="_blank">styled-components</a>,
which is an evolution of the CSS Modules concept his co-maintainer
Glen Maddern introduced <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIyhhHTmsXE" target="_blank">at the last CSSconf EU</a>.
We predict it will be one of the most heatedly discussed ideas of the upcoming conference.
