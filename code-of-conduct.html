<p class="intro">
  All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at CSSconf EU are required to agree and comply with the following Code of Conduct. Organisers will enforce this code before and throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all participants and are committed to guaranteeing a safe and inclusive environment for everyone.
</p>

<h2>Need Help?</h2>

<p>
  You can reach the <a href="/team/">team, Kristina and Polly</a> at contact@cssconf.eu. An emergency number will also be available closer to the date of the event.</p>

<h2>The quick version</h2>

<p>
  We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We will not tolerate harassment in any form. Sexual language and imagery are not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Anyone, regardless of their participation in the conference, violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event without a refund at the discretion of the conference organizers.
</p>

<h2>The less-quick version</h2>

<p>
  Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
</p>

<p>
  Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
</p>

<p>
  Volunteers, sponsors, and on-site staff are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.
</p>

<p>
  If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference without refund.
</p>

<p>
  If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact us immediately. You can reach the <a href="/team/">team, Kristina and Polly</a> at contact@cssconf.eu. On the day of the event, you can approach conference staff at any time.
</p>

<p>
  Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment in order to ensure that they feel safe throughout the duration of the event. We value your participation!
