JESSICA:  Hello!  Wooh!  Welcome back for the home stretch, for the last three talks. Our next speaker, Patricia, I'm really excited about her talk - yes, wooh for Patricia. She's going to talk about CSS, art history, and the connections between art and CSS. Yes!  Patricia's fantastic, and, if you are wanting to her later, ask her about food and mid-century furniture.
PATRICIA:  I have too many hobbies!
JESSICA:  We flew together yesterday. Once we got off the train, we realised my iPad was still on that plane and her luggage was not on the plane and it should have been.
PATRICIA:  I have one other outfit and that's it.
JESSICA:  A extra huge round of applause for Patricia, everyone!  [Applause].
PATRICIA:  So, so I guess this is it the last round of talks at CSSconf EU. So sad. Let's get the party started so we can go to the party afterwards. I want first off to stay a big thanks to the organisers. They put together a beautiful, amazing wonderful event, so, if you guys could give the organisers a round of applause. [Applause].  I owe them all so much for helping me out. I'm honoured to be up here with the other great speakers. I have to give a quick disclaimer really quick. My slides do feature some like optical illusions and animations that, if you feel like visual sensitivity, I will not be offended if you need to get up and go outside and take a walk because please take care of yourself first. I will try to give you a washing before something visually animated pops up on the screen. But, today, we are going to talk about CSS and art history and all of the wonderful things we have in common.
As a front-end developer, we work in an industry where our job is to build things for public consumption, and the thing is that, often like we are given sets of designs and photographs, and texts, and we have to put that all together in order to tell a story on a website. And, what better place to look at for inspiration of visual story-telling than art history?
So the object of art is not to reproduce reality but to create a reality of the same intensity. Effective story-telling in art comes from a long, long history of patterns, and symbolism, and visual cues that have been developed over the course of time and what is interesting is that today we're kind of in the opposite situation:  back in medieval times and in the Renaissance, literacy was the majority - people weren't as capable of reading as they are today, obviously, and when we work on websites, our job is often to make text available and readable. However, we are still working in a two-dimensional medium. We are still working with a screen that has quite a lot in common with the canvas and with the frame. So, during this talk, there's going to be a lot of little examples of fun, CSS things that I felt inspired to share with you. This is one of my favourite websites. It's actually in Flash, but I'm working on building a CSS/JavaScript version of it. This is animated and move around a lot. A game called first-person Tetris. I waste a lot of of time playing this!  So, instead of the pieces rotating, the whole screen rotates, and the reason why I'm showing this to you is because we are often forget that, like, as long as we look at the physical world within the three-dimensionality of vision seems to offer no problem until we recall that the optical input for all of our visual experience consists of two-dimensional projections on the retina. Like, this is a game but it is also a piece of art because it is a two-dimensional representation of space that you have a three-dimensional relationship with.  I've only got past level ten because it starts to go really fast and you get really, really dizzy. Like I was saying, we are dealing with a two-dimensional world, right, on our screens, and our screens give us access to the same things that you have access to when you're putting together a painting. We have access to space, lines, and light, and colour and all these things that Kohl together to make form which is what we are talking about when we look at or history is the nature of form. So, let's break that down a little bit more. So this is a wonderful Georgia O'Keeffe quote I love where she's talking about what it is to make art the reason we elevate art is that art gives you the chance - it gives you a chance to have an intimate emotional relationship with something. And that intimate, emotional relationship comes from the arrangement of shapes and lines and colour, and awful these things that are just two-dimensional tools, and we have access to at CSS. They all contribute to expression. So, starting back from, like, way, way beginning, these are cave paintings in the South of France from 30,000 to 32,000 years ago. It is hard to carbon-date these things. You can see there is already an understanding of form. There is white and there is dark, so there's an understanding of highlighting, and saturation. There's movement - the animals are running across the rock, right?  But just like early web design before we had access to, like, Flexbox and CSS Grid and these cool things that we have now, just like in art history, CSS was used in basic motifs that were changed with friends across time, so cave paintings being the earliest, and then maybe you look at Greco-Roman vase art and sticking to the same motif in the same way that web development stuck to the same motif. Then we had the Renaissance. The Renaissance was responsible for basically making us go from a representational form of art to a risk form of -- to a realistic form of art. I believe right now we exist in a Renaissance period of social security  CSS but we are still doing the job of tradesmen and craftsmen, dictated to us what it is we are communicating through our web development on to the screen, the same as how the artist during the Renaissance by the Medici in the family, and countries all across Europe, and one of the greatest contributions of the Renaissance to art was the concept of vanishing points.  So a vanishing point is a geometrical representation of an expression of space by locating a point on the horizon and pulling it into the foreground, you're able to create three-dimensional objects so, before during medieval and like on Greek vases you would see a flat two-dimensional picture of a person, but now with vanishing points, we have the ability to truly understand space. And here you can see the famous Last Supper which is a fresco by Leonardo da Vinci. Here, he takes great advantage of the vanishing point, but not only that, there is hidden messages with this composition in and of itself. The fact that the vanishing point is centred and the horizon is centred is a method of demonstrating symmetry and symmetry demonstrates perfection because, for two things to be equal on both sides, that is perfection, and back in the Renaissance, that was considered godliness. We derive this expectation of perfection and centring, and it is probably why all of us have to struggle with vertical centre alignment so much to this day, because of this crap!  Here's a more intense version before after looking at where the horizon exists and the vanishing point exists in the last supper, we can take it to the next level with Raphael and his School of Athens in the Vatican. The vanishing point is between Plato and Aristotle therefore focusing our focus on the two characters in the centre. There are also lines of geometric form that are happening in the foregrounds, and, with the crossing of the lines, we see that this is like a much more complex version of what was started in the Renaissance, like this is the growth of it. This is vanishing points being executed with perspective origin, and because my slides are all HTML and CSS, I can show you how I did it. All this right here is how I'm able to execute the same thing, that da Vinci and Raphael executed in my code. So using vanishing points, also it gives us access to depth, and, in that same sense we have access to depth with vanishing points, our screens are like windows. They're showing us what is within in the same way that a frame shows you what is within a painting. And this was the big movement that happened in the Renaissance, and kind of defined art for the next few motifs into the Baroque period and the neoclassical period which is still kind of happening today. I love this piece of art. I can't pronounce his name, but it kind of looks familiar, right?  You've seen this pose before, except not - and that's because it's a physical representation of Napoleon I at his coronation painted by Ingris. You can see the artist while he took inspiration, and we're still like dealing with depth and dealing with these patterns. We have an inherent cultural understanding of these patterns. Like you understand that I see he's problem announcing he is the king, but in the same way that Iced Tea is copying Napoleon, Napoleon is copying God. This is  van Eck's altar piece, an altar piece with multiple panels, and you can see the similarities between God the Father and Napoleon.
And, we continue to use these - prevalence of hamburger menus and representations that we all understand and have a user experience that is cohesive and everyone across the board gets that, and so this I that I that, as a community, we should always be aware of those choices that are being made, and what that means for the future generations of web development, and the things that we are passing along.  But, you know, you don't need to go to school and get a masters degree to be an artist. Anybody something an artist. Anybody can create things, just like you can create anything out of CSS with your code, and I think that looking at the artists of today, it's going to help us figure out what the future of CSS looks like. After the neoclassical period, which is what we saw with Napoleon, we had the advent of photography. Photography meant that we no longer needed paintings to represent real life because, with photographs, we could document real life of quicker, albeit slightly expensive but not nearly as expensive as hiring an artist to paint something for you. At the same time, psychology was being developed, and people were being encouraged to explore their feelings and emotions, so, during this period, that's when we had the birth of abstract art.  Now we are looking at not the figure within, but the figure on. The canvas as a surface is just as important to look at in terms of art as the canvas as a window, and here we have a piece by Chuck Close, a portrait of Cara Walker, a famous artist who I adore. Chuck Close abstracts the portrait by painting individual water colours like pixels, and therefore turning our focus away from the photograph as a whole, and the image and figure as a whole and instead we have a chance to focus on what is on the canvas, and the texture, and the colour, and the abstraction, and I think that we are going to see more and more of this in the future with CSS as we become more aware of the screen as a surface, as opposed to a window. A little side trivia about Chuck Close:  he has prosopagnosia which is face blindness, so, when he paints these portraits, he will look at the photo and look back at the painting and go back and forth and he actually doesn't recognise the person while he's doing these paintings, which is why like what people have theorised which is why his paintings seem so photographic because he's so able to separate himself from the person who is painting, and he just sees the elements of what he's working with. In the same way that we work with pixels and now we are working with CSS Grid and stuff, we can look at this piece and in the how it's been abstracted into something that is completely different from the way we used to handle art. It ran across this very interesting piece that Ivana showed me earlier today. Using typography portrait by Caroline Portugal, she uses typography and svg animation to subvert the meaning of text. Just as Chuck Close is subverting the meek of the portrait, we can subvert the text we are given to display on a website to provide information, and we can provide information of our own making. Even more deeply, abstract, we can look at Mark Rothco's paintings of colour. What you don't know is that there are tiny thin layers of colour across the whole canvas. Mark Rothco would paint very, very thin layers over and over and over to develop this glowing luminosity something that I akin a lot to the fact that our screens are actually light glowing from behind, and so I like to look at Rothco and consider the fact that when we are creating something with CSS oftentimes, colour and light have something to do with the expression and the emotion that is caused by what you're looking at on your screen. In 1816, a writing on vision and colour, which explained the rate of intensity of colour saturation, and he developed a spectrum of colour that he deemed high - low to high to low intensity with black on one end of the spectrum, moving into violet, blue, and green, green and red being the centre, the highest contrasting, moving down into orange, yellow, and white. You can see here there is no green, there is no red. This is a very subdued painting with notes of violet, and notes of blue, and we have a calming sense when we look at this painting, the colours communicate to us a sense of peace.  But, when you look at something like original and yellow, it drives up your heart rate. It gets you excited, it full of intensity, and - like orange and yellow. In the -- like the way you can abstract emotion, you can do the same with colour. We can't always look at colour as it really is. Sometimes, it's determined by the context, and here light and colour help to define space. But here, we have the absence of colour, the absence of saturation helps us to define space, so this is a piece of optical art by Bridget Reilly. She was basically the front-runner of this art motif, and she was also the first woman to win an international prize in painting at the Venice Biennial in 1968. She's expressing movement by manipulating the surface with depth and contour and saturation. This is something we can execute ourselves with code by manipulating a line, by manipulating its curvature. It creates a wonderful sense of tension, and session of movement across the page, even though it is static, there is no movement in it, but as you look at it, it begins to kind of wave back and forth.  And to give you a sense of how we can utilise these abstractions through code, this is a project that my friend Ainslie Wagner worked on where she took sound and used it to man its late an abstract representation with colours and light. They did this wonderful performance piece that I love. [Electronic sound]. This is make art with code. This is the most abstract that you can get. As we move towards pure expression and away from our dependency on text, newspapers, derivative layouts with columns and rows of text, I hope that you all are a little inspired to go out and make something fun and interesting. Thank you.
JESSICA:  Thank you. [Applause].  Thank you, Patricia.
